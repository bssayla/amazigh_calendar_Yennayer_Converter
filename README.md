# Yennayer Converter

This is a simple web app to convert Gregorian dates to Amazigh dates. since I was looking to know the Amazigh date for my birthday, but I couldn't find a simple tool to do that, so I decided to build one. I used the `streamlit` library to build the web app, the model is a simple python script. the model is hosted on the `huggingface` model hub.
